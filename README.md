Hi, my name is Rodrigo. I am a full-stack web developer skilled with JavaScript and Python. I can create full web applications from scratch; React for the front end and Node for the back end. However, while I enjoy making web applications my real passion for coding comes from the problem solving nature of it. Using a language, such as Python, to solve problems has become a daily part of my life.
